I started with that foundation and then customized it to fit my needs — updating the design and adding features that make the site meet the needs of my brand. Examples of custom work include:  

- A slugified **Projects section** with case study pages, featuring tech stack badges, project icons, and optional GitHub source code buttons.  
- A streamlined **blog system** with a “← All Blog Posts” button for easier navigation.  
- Simplified **header and footer**, keeping only GitHub and LinkedIn for a cleaner professional focus.  
- A **brand-aligned color scheme and custom icons** to match my personal identity.  

A full breakdown of all customizations can be found below.

- Custom **brand-aligned dark theme** with accent gradients.
- Added custom **SVG logos** for Power Automate, Excel, SharePoint, Jira, etc.
- Integrated icons directly into **project cards** and **project detail pages**.
