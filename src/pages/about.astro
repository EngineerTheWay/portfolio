<p>
  I'm Caleb, a USAF veteran with over 8 years of experience across military intelligence, cyber operations support, and training leadership, now focused on enterprise technology and digital transformation.
</p>

<p>
  Over my military career, I moved being a Persian-Farsi language analyst supporting cyber operations at USCYBERCOM to leading training programs that shaped the next generation of military linguists. Those roles developed strong analytical skills and a security-minded approach to solving complex technical and organizational problems, while reinforcing the importance of clear communication between technical and non-technical teams.
</p>

<p>
  In recent leadership roles, I improved training outcomes by automating workflows and optimizing processes using enterprise cloud productivity and automation platforms. This work sharpened my focus on helping organizations implement, secure, and modernize the systems that support day-to-day operations.
</p>

<p>
  I’m currently completing my Master’s in Information Technology with a concentration in cybersecurity while building hands-on experience across cloud infrastructure, security, and automation. I’m transitioning from active duty in November 2026 and pursuing roles focused on modernizing and securing enterprise technology environments.
</p>

<p>
  Outside of work, I enjoy being in the mountains hiking, backpacking, and skiing, traveling to explore new cultures and cuisines, spending time with my fiancée and our dogs, and gaming with friends.
