  <p>
    I’m Caleb, an Air Force veteran transitioning into the tech sector with a focus on bridging business and technology.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the past 8 years, I’ve worked across cyber operations, intelligence, and military training—leading diverse teams, managing programs, and driving process improvements in high-stakes environments. Those experiences taught me how to translate complex systems into clear outcomes and lead people through change.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I prepare for my next chapter, I’m completing a Master’s in Information Technology with a concentration in cybersecurity while building hands-on expertise in cloud platforms, cybersecurity, and business analysis. My goal is to help organizations adopt modern systems, strengthen security, and create meaningful impact through technology.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond the technical side, I’m passionate about mentorship and connecting people with the tools and systems that make their work more effective. For me, technology is most powerful when it empowers people, simplifies complexity, and drives lasting impact.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, camping, and exploring new restaurants. At home, you’ll often find me playing video games, planning my next trip abroad, or studying new languages and cultures.
