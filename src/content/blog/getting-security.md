### Why Security+ Mattered for Me

As I transitioned out of the military, I wanted a credential that could translate my background in IT fundamentals, cyber operations, and graduate-level security coursework into something the civilian world immediately recognizes. Security+ fit that role cleanly. It provided a widely understood baseline while reinforcing the foundation I had already been working from.

The value of Security+ wasn’t that the material was entirely new. Most of the domains were concepts I had encountered academically or applied operationally in the military. What the certification did force was precision. It required me to formalize ideas I had previously used intuitively and to understand where terminology, models, and frameworks meaningfully differ.

In that sense, Security+ served less as a starting point and more as a translation layer: a way to align prior experience with the language and expectations of the broader industry. <br><br>

### Where I Focused My Attention

With that goal in mind, my preparation centered on areas where nuance matters more than familiarity:

- **Frameworks and terminology** — translating operational concepts into standardized language (NIST, ISO, HIPAA, CASB, AAA)  
- **Identity and access models** — understanding where models like RBAC, ABAC, and Zero Trust diverge in theory and application  
- **Risk and response concepts** — clarifying distinctions such as BCP vs. DRP and formal incident response phases  
- **Protocols and cryptography** — reinforcing details that are easy to gloss over in day-to-day work  

The common thread across these areas was accuracy. Security+ rewarded clarity and precision across foundational concepts. <br><br>

### How I Approached Preparation

I briefly reviewed concepts I already understood and then focused primarily on areas where I needed more reinforcement.

- **ChatGPT** for targeted clarification when concepts needed tightening  
- **Florida Tech coursework** in *Secure Networks & Communication* and *Host-Based Security*, which aligned closely with the exam’s technical domains  
- **Jason Dion’s Udemy course** to systematically review encryption standards and Zero Trust Architecture  
- **Light memorization tools** (Anki and Pocket Prep) for details like ports, protocols, and closely related definitions  
 <br><br>

### What I Took Away

Security+ didn’t change the direction of my career, but it did strengthen the foundation it’s built on. It helped translate military and academic experience into language that resonates across the industry and reinforced the importance of precision when working with foundational concepts, especially with regards to security.
