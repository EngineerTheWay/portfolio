### Why I Wanted to Get Security+  

Early in my career, I trained on everything from IT fundamentals to hands-on ethical hacking with Metasploit. As I prepared to transition out of the service, I wanted to fill in any gaps and way to tie all that experience together.   

The certification gave me a foundation in cybersecurity & IT risk management—certifying my knowledge in computer networks, risk frameworks, cryptography, and incident response. Security+ gave me something that would build on my graduate coursework and military background while also being recognized broadly in the private sector. <br><br>


### Things I have to review

Even with coursework and prior experience, certain areas I had to brush up on:

### 1. Abbreviations & Frameworks
- Agreements: SLA, MOU, ISA, BPA, etc `(these are surprisingly tricky)`
- Regulatory: NIST, ISO, GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, etc.
- Security concepts: CIA triad, AAA, DLP, CASB.  <br><br>

### 2. Ports & Protocols
- Common ports like HTTPS 443, SSH 22, RDP 3389 were fine.  
- Less obvious ports like TACACS+ 49, Kerberos 88, SNMP 161/162 took extra review.  
- Secure vs insecure versions (POP3 vs POP3S, etc.) were easy to mix up.  <br><br>

### 3. Authentication & Access Control
- Models: MAC, DAC, RBAC, ABAC.  
- Federation: SAML, OAuth, OpenID Connect, SSO.  
- IPSec modes and protocols (AH vs ESP, transport vs tunnel).  <br><br>

### 4. Risk & Response Concepts
- Risk math: ALE, SLE, ARO.  
- Incident response phases (prep → identify → contain → eradicate → recover → lessons learned).  
- Difference between BCP and DRP.  <br><br>

### 5. Attacks & Exploits
- XSS vs CSRF vs SQLi.  
- Password attacks: rainbow tables, dictionary, brute force, spraying.  
- Social engineering varieties: phishing, smishing, vishing, pretexting.  
- Various types of DDoS: amplified, reflected, and volumetric.  <br><br>


### How I Studied  

I didn’t overcomplicate my prep:

- **ChatGPT** — my study partner for weak areas. I’d dump my notes in and ask it to quiz me, explain concepts differently, or create mnemonics until I understood them.  
- **Florida Tech Graduate Courses** — *Secure Networks & Communication* and *Host-Based Security* provided deeper context for Security+ material, from the **TCP/IP and OSI models** to a technical understanding of **malware types** and other vulnerabilites. These courses made the exam content more intuitive.  
- **Jason Dion’s Udemy Course** — clear explanations for areas I was weak on.
- **Anki** — I used ChatGPT to generate a CSV with cloze cards with the top ports and protocols.
- **Pocket Prep App** — perfect for reviewing tricky sections on the go and hammering down the areas I kept missing.  <br><br>


### Making It Happen  

I was able to use **[AF COOL](https://myairforcebenefits.us.af.mil/Benefit-Library/Federal-Benefits/Air-Force-Credentialing-Opportunities-On-Line-(AF-COOL)?serv=26)** (an Air Force credentialing program) to fully cover the cost of my Security+ credential. Having that support meant I could focus entirely on studying, but also encouraged me not to retest and pay it back.<br><br>

 
### Key Takeaway  

Security+ wasn’t just about passing an exam: it gave me the confidence to navigate the core language of cybersecurity and translate my past experience. The process also showed me how to use the right tools (ChatGPT, coursework, courses, and apps) to turn weak spots into strengths without overstudying.
