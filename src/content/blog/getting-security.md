### Why Security+ Mattered for Me

As I transitioned out of the military, I wanted a credential that tied together my background in IT fundamentals, cyber operations, hands-on tool use, and graduate-level security coursework. Security+ was the cleanest way to translate that experience into something the civilian world immediately recognizes and to establish a solid foundation for more advanced study.

The certification forced me to formalize core concepts I’d already encountered operationally or academically, including networking, risk, identity and access models, cryptography, and incident response. These were areas I had used in practice but never needed to define in a formal exam. <br><br>

### What I Focused On

Even with prior experience, several areas required deliberate review:

- **Acronyms & frameworks** — NIST, ISO, HIPAA, SLAs, MOUs, CASB, AAA  
- **Ports & protocols** — non-obvious ones like Kerberos (88), TACACS+ (49), and SNMP (161/162)  
- **Identity & authentication models** — MAC, DAC, RBAC, ABAC; SAML vs. OAuth; Zero Trust components  
- **Risk & response** — ALE/SLE/ARO, incident response phases, BCP vs. DRP  
- **Attack types** — injection attacks, XSS vs. CSRF, password attacks, and wireless attack categories  
- **Cryptography & PKI** — symmetric vs. asymmetric crypto, PKI workflows, hashing, WPA3, and Diffie-Hellman  

**TL;DR:** terminology and nuance. The exam rewards precision across foundational concepts.<br><br>

### How I Prepared

I kept my approach focused and practical:

- **ChatGPT** — targeted clarification for concepts that needed reinforcement  
- **Florida Tech coursework** — *Secure Networks & Communication* and *Host-Based Security* aligned closely with exam content, especially technical topics like buffer flows and polymorphic malware  
- **Jason Dion’s Udemy course** — strong reinforcement of encryption standards, hashing, and Zero Trust Architecture  
- **Anki** — cloze cards for ports and protocols that weren’t already muscle memory  
- **Pocket Prep** — rapid multiple-choice practice, especially helpful for distinctions like BCP vs. DRP  

Rather than trying to memorize everything, I concentrated on the areas that weren’t already second nature from my experience.<br><br>

### What I Took Away

Security+ gave me a more structured understanding of concepts I’d previously applied in academic and operational contexts. It also helped translate military experience into language that resonates across the broader cybersecurity field. More than anything, it reinforced that consistent, focused study beats brute-forcing material every time.
