### Why Security+ Mattered

Coming out of the military, I wanted a credential that tied together everything I’d learned — IT fundamentals, cyber operations, hands-on tool use, and the grad-level security work I’d done. Security+ was the cleanest way to translate that experience into something the civilian world instantly understands and lay a strong foundation for later, more advanced studies.

Security+ forced me to solidify the basics: networks, risk, auth models, IAM, cryptography, and incident response. Stuff I’d used in practice in school or seen operationally, but never had to define in a clean, exam-friendly way.

### What I Actually Focused On

Even with my background, I had a few areas that needed extra attention:

- **Acronyms & frameworks** — NIST, ISO, HIPAA, SLAs, MOUs, CASB, AAA… all the alphabet soup.
- **Ports & protocols** — the “non-obvious” ones like Kerberos 88, TACACS+ 49, or SNMP 161/162.
- **Auth models & identity** — MAC, DAC, RBAC, ABAC; SAML vs OAuth; Zero Trust components like PEP, Control vs. Data planes, etc.
- **Risk & response** — ALE/SLE/ARO, IR phases, BCP vs DRP.
- **Attacks** — especially injection types, XSS vs CSRF, password attacks, and WiFi/Bluetooth attack classifications.
- **Cryptography & PKI** — symmetric vs asymmetric, PKI flows, hashing, WPA3, DH key exchange, etc.

**TLDR:** the terminology and nuance. The exam demands precision on these core concepts.

### How I Studied (Without Overdoing It)

I kept my study process simple and focused:

- **ChatGPT** — quick, targeted research on concepts I needed to clarify or had questions on.
- **Florida Tech courses** — my *Secure Networks* and *Host-Based Security* classes made a lot of the exam content feel natural, especially the more technical topics like how buffer flows or polymorphic malware actually work.
- **Jason Dion’s Udemy course** — great for reinforcing concepts like encryption standards, hashing, Zero Trust Architecture.
- **Anki** — port/protocol cloze cards generated with ChatGPT for anything that wasn’t already in muscle memory.
- **Pocket Prep** — fast reps on multi-choice questions; super helpful for nailing distinctions like BCP vs DRP.

I didn’t try to memorize everything; instead, I focused my studies on the parts that weren’t already second nature.

### What I Took Away

Security+ gave me a more formal, structured understanding of concepts I’d used in grad school and operationally. It also helped me translate military and academic experience into a language the broader cyber world recognizes. More than anything, it reminded me that having the right tools and staying consistent beats brute-forcing study material every time.
