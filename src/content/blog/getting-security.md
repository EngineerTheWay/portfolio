### Why I Wanted to Get Security+  

During my military career, I trained on everything from IT fundamentals to hands-on ethical hacking with Metasploit. As I prepared to transition out of the service, I wanted a certification that tied this experience together and was recognized in the private sector.

Security+ gave me a solid foundation in networks, risk frameworks, cryptography, and incident response, building on my graduate coursework and military background while validating my skills in a broader context. <br><br>


### Areas I had to review

Even with prior experience, I needed extra focus in a few areas:

### 1. Abbreviations & Frameworks
- Agreements: SLA, MOU, ISA, BPA, etc.
- Regulatory: NIST, ISO, GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, etc.
- Security concepts: CIA, AAA, DLP, CASB, and about 100 more.  <br><br>

### 2. Ports & Protocols
- Common ports like HTTPS 443, SSH 22, RDP 3389 were fine.  
- Less obvious ports like TACACS+ 49, Kerberos 88, SNMP 161 vs 162 took extra review.  
- Secure vs insecure versions (POP3 vs POP3S, etc.) were easy to mix up.  <br><br>

### 3. Authentication & Access Control
- Models: MAC, DAC, RBAC, ABAC.
- Zero Trust: Control vs. Data Planes, PEP, etc.
- Federation: SAML, OAuth, OpenID Connect, SSO.  
- IPSec modes and protocols (AH vs ESP, transport vs tunnel).  <br><br>

### 4. Risk & Response Concepts
- Risk math: ALE, SLE, ARO.  
- Incident response phases (prep → identify → contain → eradicate → recover → lessons learned).  
- Difference between BCP and DRP <br><br>

### 5. Attacks & Exploits
- **Injection**: SQLi, LDAP, command injection  
- **Input exploitation**: buffer overflows, string vulnerabilities  
- **Cross-site**: XSS, CSRF  
- **Password attacks**: brute force, dictionary, spraying, credential stuffing, rainbow tables
- **Social engineering**: phishing, spear phishing, smishing, vishing, pretexting, tailgating  
- **Malware**: trojans, worms, ransomware, logic bombs, rootkits  
- **Network**: DoS/DDoS (volumetric, amplified, reflected), MITM (ARP poisoning, session hijacking)  
- **Wireless**: evil twin APs, deauth, replay attacks  
- **Physical/hardware**: supply chain compromises, rogue devices, skimmers <br><br> 

### 6. Cryptography & PKI
- Symmetric vs asymmetric encryption (AES vs RSA/ECC) 
- Stream vs Block Ciphers 
- PKI components: certificates, CAs, CRLs, OCSP  
- Diffie-Hellman (key exchange methods)  
- Hashing & collisions: why SHA-256+ is stronger than MD5 or SHA-1  
- WPA3 vs WPA/WPA2 
- Use cases: encrypting data at rest, in transit, and in use <br><br>

### How I Studied  

I didn’t overcomplicate my prep:

- **ChatGPT** — my study partner for weak areas. I’d dump my notes in and ask it to quiz me, explain concepts differently, or create mnemonics until I understood them.  
- **Florida Tech Graduate Courses** — *Secure Networks & Communication* and *Host-Based Security* provided deeper context for Security+ material, from the **TCP/IP and OSI models** to a technical understanding of **malware types** and other vulnerabilites. These courses made the exam content more intuitive.  
- **Jason Dion’s Udemy Course** — clear explanations for areas I was weak on.
- **Anki** — I used ChatGPT to generate a CSV with cloze cards with the top ports and protocols.
- **Pocket Prep App** — perfect for reviewing tricky sections on the go and hammering down the areas I kept missing.  <br><br>
 
### Key Takeaway  

Studying for and passing Security+ gave me the confidence to navigate the core language of cybersecurity and translate my past military experience. The process also showed me how to use the right tools (ChatGPT, coursework, courses, and apps) to turn weak spots into strengths without overstudying.
