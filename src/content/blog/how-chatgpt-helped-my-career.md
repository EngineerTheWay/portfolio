### An Unexpected Career Mentor

Choosing to leave the military after nearly a decade wasn’t easy. The transition meant letting go of structure and mission and figuring out what came next for me and my family.

I had unique experiences in the military and I wanted to use that experience to turn the page and start a new career in the private sector. That’s when I turned to ChatGPT.  

It helped me sort through ideas, clarify options, and imagine new directions. Unexpectedly, it became a trusted sounding board during one of the biggest shifts in my life.  <br><br>

### How I’ve Used ChatGPT

- **Clarifying My Career Direction:** I used ChatGPT to analyze potential career paths that aligned with my goals, interests, and ideal lifestyle.  

- **Researching Schools:** It helped me make grounded decisions about what programs would be best for me to pursue with my GI Bill after seperation.  

- **Prioritizing Certifications:** It helped me narrow down what certifications and trainings were worth pursuing (and what weren’t) based on my goals. 

- **Staying Accountable:** I set up rules and guidelines in my chats to help me stay focused and take consistent action.  

- **Energy Allocation:** I used it to evaluate which investments, whether degrees, certifications, or projects, would actually move my career forward to what I wanted to do.  <br><br>


### Some Tricks I’ve Learned

- **Talk to it like a mentor or thought partner.** Write your thoughts out in their entirety. LLM models work best when all your ideas are out there, you’re just working to fine tune them.  

- **Use it to challenge your ideas.** Ask it to expand, question, or play devil’s advocate for your ideas. You can even challenge your own ideas against one another.  

- **Use threads and memory intentionally.** My long-term chats with ChatGPT helped me track growth over time and build on past insights. It can help keep where you were a few months ago in mind.

- **Get learning support.** From technical skills to professional development, ChatGPT is a powerful tool for learning new material. Just make sure to check it for accuracy.  

- **Set boundaries and rules.** Tell it what you want it to do and what you don’t. This helps shape better, more useful outputs.  <br><br>

### Things to Keep in Mind

- **Always bring your own ideas.** Let it support your thinking, not replace it. Treat it as scaffolding to get past mental blocks and identify blind spots. 

- **Fact-check everything, especially research.** It’s powerful and fast, but not always accurate. Be to check sources and verify validity. Even the best models hallucinate. 

- **Beware of perfection paralysis.** The temptation to over-optimize is real. Authenticity matters more. Once you have a solid draft or plan, act on it.  <br><br>

### TL;DR

ChatGPT won’t replace the need for career mentorship but it has helped me take ownership of my transition and build momentum.  

Using it during my career transition has helped me learn to use AI more intentionally and has me very excited for how LLM models will continue to help individuals unlock their potential.
