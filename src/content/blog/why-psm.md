### Why I Chose PSM I  

Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) was the first certification I pursued during my career transition. It fit perfectly as I’d already been applying agile principles for years in the military through process improvements and intelligence workflows. I wanted to formalize that experience with an industry-standard credential that would translate directly into the tech sector.  <br><br>

### What is Scrum and Why Does It Matter?  

Scrum is an agile framework for managing complex projects. It’s used widely in software, IT, security, and digital transformation, and has grown far beyond tech because it helps teams handle complexity and adapt quickly.  <br><br>

###  What Does the Scrum Master Do?  

The Scrum Master is one of three official Scrum roles. By the Scrum Guide, they don’t “manage” the team, but instead coach both the team and the organization on how to apply Scrum effectively. They’re leaders of process and culture, not taskmasters.  

The [Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I)](https://www.scrum.org/assessments/professional-scrum-master-i-certification) from [Scrum.org](https://scrum.org) validates your understanding of Scrum’s foundations and prepares you for that role.  <br><br>

###  Building My Foundation  

Alongside Scrum, I deepened my skills in business analysis and agile project management:  

- [**Microsoft Career Essentials in Business Analysis**](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/career-essentials-in-business-analysis-by-microsoft-and-linkedin) — stakeholder roles, user stories, and backlog management.  <br>
- [**Atlassian Agile Project Management**](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/atlassian-agile-project-management-professional-certificate) — practical view of Scrum in Jira and agile teamwork.  <br>

These helped me connect the theory of Scrum with real-world workflows.  <br><br>

### How I Prepped for PSM I  

- Read the **Scrum Guide** three times, taking notes.  
- Used the [free Scrum.org practice test](https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/scrum-open) until I consistently hit 100% three runs in a row.  
- Sat the exam (80 questions, 60 minutes). I flagged a few questions but finished with time to spare.  <br>

> **Tip:** If you miss practice test questions, always go back to the Scrum Guide. The answers are right there.  

### Final Thoughts  

Scrum isn’t just for software. It’s a way of approaching complex work in any environment. For me, PSM I validated the agile practices I’d already been using **and** gave me a credential that bridges my military background with the civilian industry.
